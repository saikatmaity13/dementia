nodementia,Angela Lansbury,1,"Of course, I'd always been associated with movies and playing a certain kind of lady in the movies. I don't like to talk about them as being heavies because they weren't really. They were all characters and interesting. They had an edge to them, some of them, more so than others. I suppose I had that label of being a very strong, dramatic actress. When I had the chance to do Mame, it was just a complete switch of characters. Again, Mame was a character, but what a devil may care, charming, vivacious, effervescent person she was. And certainly, I'd never played that. So that was the thing that really sort of set me up on Broadway, was Mame. And thank goodness it was, because I played her not many times since. In fact, only one other time have I played Mame since today when I'm opening here in Dallas for the third outing with the lady.",Angela Lansbury_1.wav,C:\dementia_data\nodementia-20251028T053645Z-1-002\nodementia\Angela Lansbury\Angela Lansbury_1.wav
nodementia,Angela Lansbury,3,"I only really come alive as an interesting person in my estimation when I'm acting, because I can take on all kinds of physical, emotional attributes which I personally don't have. I'm an empty vessel. I am a very straightforward, plain thinking, doing person. But I fill myself with all of these things that create a character. And that to me is the fun of being an actor. Is you're not yourself, you're 50 different people. And you take these people and you use them and characterize an individual.",Angela Lansbury_3.wav,C:\dementia_data\nodementia-20251028T053645Z-1-002\nodementia\Angela Lansbury\Angela Lansbury_3.wav
nodementia,BarbraStreisand,1,"That's a good question. But when I'm making the movie, I spend the whole weekend in bed, just with food, lots of food, and just try to be quiet. Try to just come back to my inner small self, and dream, and imagine, and then go out and do the work the next week. But is there a secret to it? No. I mean, how do I relieve stress? No. I can't think of a particular one.",BarbraStreisand_1.wav,C:\dementia_data\nodementia-20251028T053645Z-1-002\nodementia\Barbra Streisand\BarbraStreisand_1.wav

I saw Eliza Mannella years ago get up in my friend's living room. And that's when I said after 27 years of not performing live, except for charities and political fundraisers perhaps, I said, how could she do this? How does she get up and sing in front of people without the lights being off?

nodementia,BarbraStreisand,3,"I think it was at a very young age that I thought, I'd like to be the best at singing. At first it was acting. I wanted to be an actress first. I only became a singer because I couldn't get a job as an actress. And I thought I knew I had a good voice from when I was a kid, and we used to sing on the stoops in Brooklyn. And I was known for having a good voice and no father, because every other kid had a father. So I was unique. And when you have a kind of void in your life and a strange childhood, I wasn't seen. It was like I was pushed around. My mother wanted me to be a teacher or work in the school system like my father did. My father was a teacher, but my mother was a bookkeeper in the school system. And she said, you know, you get vacations and paid vacations. I thought, no, I really want to experience happiness. That I don't know. I see people going to dinner with their parents or, I mean, eating in their house. We never sat down at a table at a specific time to have dinner. So I think in the back of my mind, it was always about that. How do you get fulfilled? And that's what I did.

And I think that Slater, I met him once and I thought he had to kind of, he could have the certain simplicity that I wanted and that ultimately there'd be sort of a kind of a mystery to William because William we only find a little bit about in pieces throughout as to what must have gone on, why he came out there, what was happening in his life. But I thought there was a simplicity, I thought that would work quite well. And the woman? In Victoria, I was looking for a Spanish woman because I mean Hollywood is an enormous Spanish speaking community. I've not seen that portrayed that way and I wanted to have that element in the film. And someone had mentioned her and we ultimately got a chance to meet.

nodementia,BarryLevinson,2,"Well, in 54, this is a little bit, this would move me back because I was a little younger at that time, although I was around and saw those things. I mean, it seems inconceivable in 1954 there would have been a sign that said, you know, no Jews, you know, Jews dogs are colored allowed. It seems absolutely inconceivable, but it was. And what happens, you didn't really kind of, it snuck up on you because you didn't know that, for instance, that you were not accepted in certain places. And the movie begins that, you know, as a kid, I thought the whole world was Jewish. And then you find out that, you know, that some people are different. And then you realize that almost no one in the world is Jewish. And then you really are a minority. You know, there's this whole learning curve that you go through. So those experiences of crossing Falls Road in Baltimore were real. We went into other territories. We had met, you know, people that we had not been familiar with and they were not familiar with us, which caused a lot of, you know, problems.",BarryLevinson_2.wav,C:\dementia_data\nodementia-20251028T053645Z-1-002\nodementia\Barry Levinson\BarryLevinson_2.wav
nodementia,BarryLevinson,3,"I don't know that I look at it that way. You know, I don't take any more pride in one thing or another. I, you know, I mean, I think Rain Man in the idea that it was the first film that really created the awareness of autism and put it on the into the language, you know, and what it was, because I remember getting a letter from a mother of an autistic boy, and she was saying that the film, you know, by saying autism, that I'm finally able to say what he has and people will understand, because I was always trying to explain his condition and I never could explain it, and no one understood, and that the film defined that. And then the awareness came from it. So that's always a byproduct of a film you make, is that somehow it here, this is autism. This is what it is. And to the to the mothers and the fathers, you know, to the brothers and the sisters of an autistic, you know, you know, kid, it's now clear where before, you know, it was sort of ill defined in a way. And so the awareness that came from it, you know, but you can't predict any of those things.

nodementia,BernieSanders,3,"deal with the crises facing this country. We have massive income and wealth inequality. Half our people live on paycheck to paycheck. You've got to raise the minimum wage to a living wage. You've got to do that. We have an infrastructure that is collapsing. We have got to address the existential threat of climate change. And when you do that, Chuck, when you make those investments, we create millions of good paying jobs. We are the only major country not to guarantee health care to all people is a right. The only major country not to have paid family and medical leave. We pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. Hundreds of thousands of kids can't afford to go to college and millions leave school deeply in debt. Well, you know what? You've got to address those issues. Meanwhile, you've got two people on top who own more wealth than the bottom 40% of America. You've got major corporation after major corporation not paying one nickel in federal income tax. Warren Buffett, one of the richest guys in the world, reminds us that the effective tax rate for working families is higher than it is for the billionaire class. So in terms of pay for, yeah, I do think we need progressive taxation, which says to the very rich, Biden says the cap should be, the floor should be 400,000.

It was like a hurricane. You were like in the middle of a hurricane. And around you, which you saw casually, were all the great films that began, all the great new actors and all that. You saw all the fashion changing. You saw the Mary Quant and the miniskirts. You saw the birth pill. You saw all these things changing all the time.

You did the play in front of the cameras every night for a whole week, like a rep. It's extraordinary, but it was very successful. And at the end all the stars came out and helped with a commercial and they were selling Ford or something or some car like that. Ian Keith one night was the butler and he necessarily didn't come on again and he went out and got ...plotzed. And at the end of the show he came back, quite rightly, why should he take a curtain call?

Even the score was torn up. I don't know why, because it's a lovely thing. And now Neville Mariner, the conductor of the LSO, who used to play the fiddle under Sir Thomas Beecham for that very film, he was in the orchestra, revived the idea. And now Sir Neville, he is.

nodementia,DionneWarwick,1,"Well, I don't really know. I think that the fact that Hal David, who I feel is probably the master lyricist of all times, wrote lyrics that were and still are as much a part of everybody's life as anything could ever be. He wrote to the heart. He didn't write about it, he wrote right to it. So you relate it totally to him. Bert and his music was so unorthodox and so out of the norm that it grabbed attention immediately. It was something that you did not hum after hearing it for the first time. You had to listen to it over and over in order to let it grow on you, and then it became a part of you. And I was the catalyst. I was the person that interpreted both and made it palatable for the listening ear. So we kind of relied upon each other's abilities to do what we did best individually and collectively. I think that primarily we are responsible, and I say it without any reservations, I really do, for some really good music at a time when that kind of music was not selling, it was not the norm of what was considered pop music.

But this has had great psychological ramifications not only for the Negro community who has had many reversals over the last couple of years because the racism which permeates American life from top to bottom in very subtle ways and in very aggressive obvious ways, the Negro has paid a terrible price for this. But somehow you'll find that racism in its subtlest and its most evil sense has worked its way deep into the fiber of the hearts and minds of many men and women. And with this going on it has had its incredible influence on my own life.

It has faith for, it takes faith, courage rather, to have faith in people that we consider to be inferior to us or enemies of ours.

And in the meantime they were violating strict prohibitions against what they were doing in Central America. Now that's pretty serious stuff. And frankly it's one of the reasons I ran for the presidency because I didn't have any intention, I never thought of running for the presidency until the Iran-Contra scandal hit.

But there was about all of that, the sense that perhaps none of it was true. He was ripping them off. It was a traveler's tales. But of course, that was also a reaction to that particular kind of Rome. Now this year, we have a very different Rome. We have a Rome which is alive, very youthful, and very, very passionate, very volatile Rome. And so I need to respond to that in a different way.

Now, when our first day off came, where did we head? Hollywood! Of course, we wanted to get some excitement, feel the buzz of being in the middle of the film capital of the world. And we found what used to be called Grauman's Chinese Theatre, it's now The Chinese Theatre, and we looked at these slabs of concrete with footprints and handprints and incredibly famous signatures signed in them. And with me was a colleague, another actor from the company playing, you know, small supporting roles, was a guy called Ben Kingsley. And Ben and I, we stood looking at this stuff going, wow, what must it be like? It must be amazing. Well, there I was getting to do it myself. And Hollywood is, American movies always had a huge influence on me. I saw them when I was young and they, well, my childhood wasn't great. So movies were an escape. As acting, for me, for a long time became an escape, I didn't have to be Patrick Stewart anymore.

nodementia,PaulVerhoeven,1,"and happily it didn't happen to me. When I was a kid, when I was seven or eight, I went into a little elevator, which were these things that are turning around. You get in and it turns around. And because I was a kid, I was playing around and put my legs over the side. And suddenly, there was exactly the same situation. The ceiling was coming. I was nearly cutting off my legs. And fortunately, part of the ceiling, they had loosened up. So it flipped around my legs. Otherwise, it would have cut my legs. And I think that was such a terrifying experience. And then nothing happened. Of course, I was saved, or whatever you want to call it. I didn't lose my legs. But it was such a gruesome idea that it nearly happened, that it obsessed my whole life. And then when I was making this movie and we got to this fight in the elevator, which was in the movie, I suddenly, this vision of horror, because it is, of course, a vision of horror, came into my mind. And I felt compelled to do it. And I might be wrong, but it was a very personal thing. But that's probably the most difficult things for a director to judge. The level of violence in things that you have experienced yourself seem to be normal to you. And then you are not a good judge of your own work, probably, anymore. That might be true.

Whenever there is a sex scene, the woman keeps on her bra. That is, let's say, really exceptional, I could tell you. But I mean, they do that and all that has to do with, let's say, making more money because the movie is not an R and is a PG, PG-13, everybody can go in and it has certainly to do with a certain degeneration of the capitalist system. We might go too far there. But I think in Holland, I felt that that was the way we lived at that time.

In many cases, what people do in their spare time, in their leisure time, is more important than the work that they, or more important, it was more significant socially, let's say, in their job. I mean, take, for instance, there are a lot of people in local government who may have relative unimportant jobs. I mean, when I say unimportant, I mean, they're very important in what they're doing, but socially not all that important, maybe employed in the factory. But in their elective job as a local councillor, of course, they're far more significant. They may be more significant, for instance, a factory worker, maybe secretary of the local football club, for instance.

Of course one enjoys the feeling of power, although I can just hold you there for a minute, I think that this question of the power of newspaper proprietors can be greatly overdone. We have certain, we have more responsibility than power I think. The newspaper can create great controversies, stir up arguments within the community discussion, can throw light on injustices, just as it can do the opposite, can hide things and be a great path for evil. It's not a perfect system obviously, but can you think of a better one? I think the important thing is that there will be plenty of newspapers with plenty of different people controlling them so that there's a variety of viewpoint and that there's a choice for the public. This is the freedom of the press that is needed. Freedom of the press mustn't be one sided just for a publisher to speak as he pleases and try and bully the community. There must be an alternative.

We have a lot of cable channels here that are going to 100 million homes. Some with very big, powerful audiences like Fox News and others like our main broadcasting which goes out to the whole 110 million homes in America. That doesn't do much news, but that's entertaining. The idea of that is when we started it, we thought, look, there's room for more choice than just three networks. Now, of course, the problem is the average home gets 80 to 100 channels, some more if they pay extra. The audience is being fragmented. So it's become, some is quite a difficult business.

nodementia,Stan Lee,1,"competitors listening, but basically I guess you have to, the big thing is the readers of our comic books, and we specialize in superhero fantasy stories, they love to be surprised. And this is really the most difficult thing when you grind out so many stories, but each story has to have an element of something new and something unexpected, you know. And our formula basically is to mix fantasy with realism. In other words, we'll take a character who's got superhuman power, let's say he can fly through the air, or like Spider-Man, he can climb on walls. We take him and we say, suppose there were such a character and he really existed in the real world, what problems would he have? What would he do if faced with a certain situation? I say if I had superhuman powers, which is not for a moment to concede that I don't, what would my intents be? For instance, wouldn't I still have to worry about dandruff or about athlete's foot or making a living or having my dates like me and so forth? So we take these bigger than life characters and we give them very lifelike qualities and problems, and that had never been done in comics before, you see.

So after 20 years of writing pap and writing things like the strips you mentioned before, I suddenly realized, gee, I can actually have fun with what I'm doing.

And then I figured just for fun, I'm going to give him personal problems because, except for you people who are perfect, your lives are perfect, but most other people have personal problems. And then I thought I'd make him a teenager, because there were no teenage superheroes that I knew of at the time. So armed with all that wonderful material, those great ideas, I ran into my publisher's office and I told him. This was my reaction, the reaction he gave me. Stan, that is the worst idea I have ever heard. First of all, and he started to give me his, because he's a very logical man, very intellectual. First of all, people hate spiders, so you can't call a hero Spider Man. You want him to be a teenager? Teenagers can only be sidekicks. And you want him to have personal problems?

And in cooperation with KQED, he asked a bunch of different artists to produce half-hour shows, including people like Walter D. Maria also did some of these programs. And so at the time I was just thinking of coming back to California, moving back to California, and I came out and contacted Arlo Acton, who was a sculptor who I'd known years before. And Arlo had been making these highly polished spherical balls made out of titanium, which he was getting from NASA. And he was swinging them from pendulums and had them suspended from the ceiling. And we had this idea to build loudspeakers also out of spheres and to surround the audience with these kind of swinging spheres. So when Jim Newman came to me with this idea about the video, I thought this would be a natural place to incorporate this whole idea of swinging speakers, the highly polished titanium spheres, and then I would play music live through it at the same time. So we did it. We went into a studio down at KQED and did the concert part of it.",TerryRiley_2.wav,C:\dementia_data\nodementia-20251028T053645Z-1-002\nodementia\Terry Riley\TerryRiley_2.wav

I was teaching at Mills College in California, teaching music classes. And students who before, who were dropping out of school and, you know, just experimenting with drugs, experimenting with music, with different lifestyles, started coming back to college and taking business classes. It was an interesting time to go from this thing of wearing suits, then going into long hair, wearing relaxed clothing, living together in communities, to going back to college to get a business degree, to make more money, to get more things. And we haven't actually been able to leave that. I think there are other influences that happen in this great universe that make these cycles go from the kind of world we had in the 60s to the kind of world we have today. So I'm sure that we'll come out of this.

nodementia,WarrenBuffett,3,"No, no, the banks earn on assets. They don't earn on net worth. You calculate it eventually as to what they earn on equity or net worth, but assets are the earning factors and they've changed the rules so that you have to have more net worth per dollar of assets and obviously if you have more net worth per dollar of assets and you're earning a constant amount on assets, your earnings on net worth go down. Now they were ungodly profitable, the better ones were. Back 15 years ago or 10 years ago even, when they had high ratios of assets to net worth and some of them even cheated in terms of having even more assets than the regulators would have allowed and you had these SIVs as they were called, Citigroup had a whole bunch of them. So they were off balance sheet ways of even controlling more assets. But all of that sort of thing has been terminated and now they've got much lower limits to the assets to net worth ratios and the bigger the bank, to some extent, the bigger the bank, the lower that ratio can be. So what was a very profitable business has been turned into a good business if executed well. It's a pretty simple business. I mean, you get your money cheap, very cheap.

This was sort of to get the concept of the kind of brutality of the South American gangsters that are running cocaine back and forth. In body double I'd always played with the idea of having a murder instrument that was electrical so that when you were going towards somebody the plug would pull out. I'd been thinking about it since sisters really. The fact that they come one after the other makes one think I'm getting into electrical hardware but that's not essentially true.

But I very much remember the sound of the flute as a little kid because being a symphony musician he practiced, you know, and prepared and warmed up. And I always used to hear this kind of beautiful sound. And to this day when I hear a flute, it just brings back my father to me. I lost him a couple of years ago. And I had an older brother who was extremely important to me, five years older, and always leading me into exciting new areas, literature, when I was young. And it was just a very magical family, I think. And we had the Italian-American influence. My dad always, although, you know, my grandparents and my parents really loved America as the Italian-American does, it always made me feel as though our Italian culture was something to be proud of.

You can make it short and just call me 26. So I thought what I need to do is I need to start all over again and have a whole new continuity. So then I thought I'm ready to do really something more ambitious. This new me with a new progression of having arrived at it. I found myself in an interesting position because a few years ago, everyone was talking about Avatar. And they were saying, this is Avatar. This is extraordinary. This is the future of cinema. It's 3D. It's extraordinary. Avatar. And people like Jeffrey Katzenberg and all the executives, all the movies are going to be 3D. And I'm thinking, wait a second. We had 3D in 1950. But why on a devil with glasses? Why is it different now? I mean, Avatar was excellent. But people don't really like to see 3D. If someone comes along with 3D without glasses, that would be curious.

nodementia,GeorgeARomero,1,"You know, it's funny, when I was in school, I never thought of making movies as a career. When I was growing up, I guess, I'd always seemed like... The people that made movies were elves that lived in magic land somewhere, you know, and on the planet of Hollywood. And I never thought seriously that a person could go and do that, you know. That was magic. That was unachievable, unattainable. But I always wanted to play around with it. And I guess I always have played around with it from the time I was a kid. Played around with the medium. I got my hands on 8mm movie cameras that my uncles had and was always horsing around with it idly. And when I first started here in Pittsburgh with friends of mine that were at Carnegie Mellon, we were all doing it idly. We were just playing around with something that we enjoyed doing. And I think none of us initially were really thinking seriously that we were starting to build a career or build a business out of it. And a couple of years later, we set up, in fact, a company to do commercials and industrial films and like that here in Pittsburgh. And because this is a big corporate market, we got some jobs, there were advertising agencies here and it was kind of being in the right place at the right time. It was right when people stopped shooting live television commercials, you know, pouring beer between the innings of the ballgame and like that.

And I was blown away by the craft of those films. And I was therefore disappointed by some of the garbage, the 50s, the cheap way they were shot. And I couldn't at that time view them as pulp. Now I can sort of celebrate the pulp aspect of it. But at that time, I was looking for that beautiful photography and it was nothing. It was a flat, they shot them in eight days.

nodementia,IanMcKellen,1,"Well now we're talking about the stage, aren't we, not about film. The trouble about the stage is that the audience sees the whole body. They are far enough away from it, even in a small theatre, to take it all in. And of course, because they're not engaged in the action of the play, they are there only to be an audience who listen and indeed a spectator who watches, they can take it all in with an objectivity which normally they don't apply. I mean, we're talking together now, and apart from our opening, I've not looked at your shoes once, but if I were in the audience, I could still, or I were the camera, I could take it all in. So that you, trying to impress the audience, will have to be aware of what your feet are doing in a way that you don't, talking to me, have to be aware of. And I think that's the initial problem that an actor has to solve. So that if I'm talking to you, all I need to bother about is my feet, and I can be doing anything I want with the rest of my body, and it's not really upsetting you because you don't, you know, you're concentrating on my eyes, but all those people have seen that I'm terribly nervous back here, even as I'm gabbing on, of being very relaxed. So an actor has to somehow, it's the great word all actors use, relax. And that relaxation is a technical achievement which is to do with relating, having control over every part of their body, their minds, so that it doesn't wander, their imaginations, their face, the tone of their voice, so that all those attributes can express.",IanMcKellen_1.wav,C:\dementia_data\nodementia-20251028T053645Z-1-001\nodementia\Ian McKellen\IanMcKellen_1.wav

But in the case of X-Men, at the heart of it is something spectacular, and I suppose X-Men, Days of Future Past, is as spectacular a movie as you can get, but at the heart of it, there's a story of desperate human concern, which is what does society do with its minorities? And mutants are a minority. They have special inborn gifts, and they are peculiar, they're odd, they're different, but does that mean that they should be treated differently or harshly or destroyed?

And King Lear is such a man, he's a very foolish man, he says it of himself, he does make some silly mistakes, he's not a cruel man, I mean he hasn't killed people as far as we can see, but he doesn't know how to deal with his daughters, we don't hear about a Mrs Lear, but you know people come and see this and say you were exactly like my granddad when he was dying, he went a bit dotty too. Or someone came along and Americans said well it's all about Trump isn't it, I don't get that at all, but an audience brings to it their own life and they measure their own experience, a family experience of politics, whatever it happens to, whatever their interest is, and match it against the experience of the characters that they're seeing act out their story.

That's why I made the film with Tony Richardson, Mademoiselle, and it was a story written by Jean Genet. You see, but nowadays the world has changed. And the big preoccupation is not men and women. How can they live together? How can they love together? And forget about the sex, because in The Lovers we made with Louis, this film that was considered so scandalous for the first time because of the love scene, nothing was shown.

And she was just sitting quite quietly, and I said to somebody, who is that girl? She looks familiar. And they said, it's Marilyn Monroe. I said, well, why isn't anyone talking to her? And they said, well, no, why? You know, because people are very blase in Hollywood, right? I mean, if she was anywhere else. So I went and talked to her. It was the first and last time that I met her, and we discovered we were both Geminis, and she was under contract at Fox, where I was under contract. And in fact, she was about to do a film called A Girl and the Red Velvet Swing, but she thought she was too old for it. And she said, you know, well, I'm 30, she said, and you know, I can't play a 17-year-old. And I knew that the studio were talking to me, talking about me to play this role. In fact, I ultimately did play the role with an American accent, which was very difficult. But she was, I was absolutely amazed at this incredible childlike vulnerability. I just, I thought she was wonderful. I think she was a very underrated actress. I see all her films. I have a collection of them on video, and I even have a lot of prints of hers of people who have painted her and drawn her, because she was an exceptional woman.

I like television, and therefore I've concertedly tried to work in all of them, as opposed to just kind of isolating myself into motion pictures. Television reaches a lot more people in motion pictures. More people on any given night see a hit television show than do one of the big all-time blockbuster movies.

People weren't talking about how much a picture was making. I mean, at a certain point, yes, how much money you would make or how much they would be able to risk, but primarily they were talking about the new Terry Malick picture or the new Paul Trader picture or that sort of new Francis Coppola film. These were films that were like, they were proud to make in a way. They were proud to underwrite, I think, filmmakers with, and I don't want to use it because it could become a dirty word, but vision, a vision, meaning that they have a way of telling a story, give them as much control. That built up to, of course, United Artists, which was an extraordinary place, making Heaven's Gate. Now, I made a picture there, Raging Bull, at the same time. In fact, Raging Bull opened 10 days before Heaven's Gate, and when that folded, we folded too with it. The picture was hardly re-released. The establishment of the UA executives left. It was a complete mess. Everything was really over at that point, but it wasn't easy to get the films made in the 70s, but there was an atmosphere of making special movies, a Robert Altman picture. There was a body of work. But when we hit the 80s, I know Altman after we suffered at 20th Century Fox at that time.

nodementia,MartinScorsese,3,"sent to you? Over the past number of years, there've been a few that have been circling about, and that sort of thing. But again, this is interesting because it was Eric Roth gave it to Bob De Niro. And De Niro and I have been trying to make a picture again since Casino. Right. It was 1995. So it was a long time since we had worked together. And we tried to find all these other projects, remakes of the Bad and the Beautiful. Remember the story about Hollywood and Kirk Douglas? All that sort of thing. And finally, it came down to a situation where we decided that we were going to make a film about an aging hit man, supposedly. And we were working on this one project. But it was kind of a genre piece. And I don't know how to do genre anymore. And the genre that I know goes back to 1948. It doesn't pay. So Eric gave him this book, supposedly the memoirs of a hit man, so to speak. Yeah. And Bob came to talk to me about the character. And as he was talking about the character, he became rather emotional about it. And I said, oh, that's something. Now, if we are going to go back into that milieu, which we were associated with in Casino and Goodfellas, then this is something that maybe we could learn a little more about ourselves and go deeper. Otherwise, what are we doing? Mm-hmm. In a sense, we're just repeating ourselves. Right. And so we took a chance. And Steve Zalien came in, wrote the script. The book is by Charles Brandt.

Absolutely, it was 13 weeks, number one. And it was a song of the year, L'amour et le ritage. It was in French.

I was able to work with the help of a partner, work my way and do quite well.

The thing that wasn't there that I really attribute to Mel and Danny, and that is their ability to relate on a level with a sense of humor. We developed that sense of humor. And a lot of it was improvisational. The entire scene of the car when they're driving away, which I desperately love after Dan Mellis jumped off the building with a guy, and he's attempted suicide, we thought. And Danny finds out from the psychiatrist that he's in trouble. And they start that scene in the car. And we drove pulling that car, and I was on the outside of the van listening. These two guys just all started to flow. That's when it really happened between the relationship with the two. We were in hysterics on the car. That, to me, is the only difference this picture makes in a lot of pictures. The action's great. I mean, I never played with action before. I love it. I surrounded myself with the best people in the world to teach me. But what I couldn't learn was to develop this wondrous relationship between Danny and Mel. It's the funniest I'd ever seen Mel.

From my point of view as a filmmaker and storyteller, we're always looking for a good story, a good tale. So that's what I was looking to begin with, and I looked at the process. I love process. And I love cause and effect. Because right in there you find all the best people, or you find people at their extremities, stretched to their extremities, and that's why it becomes interesting. What happened is it started on Earth itself, because then I saw it was perceived as an embarrassment. Why? Then I remember, of course I remember the event, but it was like a glimpse, a flash of two bodies being dragged through the streets, a negotiation for a pilot called Durant, who was released after 11 days, and it was over.

As you get more experienced or get more older, your choices become more focused. So right now, this time, I only have about four things really in process, in development, that are fundamentally written and are being polished. So off that, I don't have a list of 40 or 50 subjects. And when I first started, I didn't know what to do other than the fact I knew I wanted to make a film. And I couldn't get a camera until I wrote a script, which is the best lure in the world. You want that Bolex, which is a clockwork camera, you got to write the screenplay. So I, at that moment, was into James Joyce and particularly Ulysses with all his descriptive, wonderful descriptive passages. And so for the moment, I became James Joyce for about a couple of months. I sat down, literally wrote the screenplay. Off the screenplay, I got to borrow the film and got the camera.

nodementia,RobertVaughn,1,"Holy Ghost may have been involved in that. Well, from that, I want to get to 1956. From 1954 to 1955, no effort was made by a South Vietnamese in relation to the Geneva Accords to engage in any effort toward the elections that were to be held in July of 1956. In October of 1955, a referendum was held in South Vietnam between Bao Dai and Go Dinh Diem. Although it is rather probable that Go Dinh Diem would have won that referendum, the entire election was manipulated completely and totally by Go Dinh Niu, his brother. So we had an incredible figure of 98.6 of the vote turnout at that time. From that point on up to July 1956 when the elections were not held, no effort was ever made in relation to the provisions of the Geneva Accords in 1954. And as a result, with our help, our pressure, our support, military and economic, we failed to allow the people of Vietnam for the second time since the end of the Second World War to have a democratic election. Therefore, I think that it is immoral because I don't believe that we can stop the spread of communism by sacrificing the principles of democracy, which is indeed what we did do in Vietnam in 1956 when we stopped the elections.",RobertVaughn_1.wav,C:\dementia_data\nodementia-20251028T053645Z-1-001\nodementia\Robert Vaughn\RobertVaughn_1.wav

In the spring of 1967, at the first year of firing line, Bill Buckley's show, I had laid out a challenge that I would be happy to debate. Anybody in the Johnson administration, McNamara, Rusk, anybody on television about the war. Nobody, well, I don't blame them. What do they care what I had to say? But Buckley took the bait and we debated. It was, I think, the 26th show of his first year of firing line. At that time, Buckley's lawyer sat in the middle of the two debaters and he was to render a decision at the end of the debate who won the debate. This is Buckley's lawyer. Well, at the end of the debate, and Buckley, I might add, had just come from Disneyland with his son Christopher, who was about 12, I guess, at the time, and he was exhausted. And he probably didn't give it maybe a minute and a half to what he was going to do that day. I, on the other hand, had spent a month in a monastery reading everything that Buckley had ever written in his life, including term papers from Yale.

And what these things were, were such things as how do we make sure that people in wheelchairs can get up on a sidewalk and or get into an elevator or do any of those things. And this was horrifying to people. It was going to cost fortunes to, you know, to carve out all these curbs so that you could get people on their wheelchairs in there. Well, what has turned out to happen is that by doing that for what was considered a quote, a small group of people, we have incredibly improved the ability of a lot of other people to use them as well. For example, any parent who has a child in a stroller is now using those curved, those carved out curbs. They would not have been able to do that before, but they found it works. So it didn't just help a small group of people. Once it was done, it opened up a lot of groups of people.

But once again, by two leaders that I had no real support for, I thought the two leaders that should have been there were Rudd and Turnbull, and that would have been a genuine choice for the voters. I think Gillard is an accident, and I think Tony Abbott got there when the Liberal Party split. He got the leadership by one vote, 43-42.

The other thing is that he's an extraordinary film writer and scriptwriter with a propensity for adaptations of canonical texts. One of those, for example, is the Idiot of Dostoevsky.

dementia,DavidMilch,15,"after it had been on for a couple of years. And there was so much about its approach, the multiple story lines to which I gravitated. But I felt that it was a bit of a sanitized version of what police work was having been incarcerated myself on a number of occasions, always through false accusations, misunderstanding. And so when I came on, the first character that I introduced was a character named Sal Benedetta, who was a bad cop, who was always beaten up, Charlie Haidt, and so on, and who seemed to me to be a more accurate representation of at least one aspect of policing. And Benedetta wound up robbing a bank, and they send a robot in. He was hiding in a vault, and they send a robot in so they can watch what he's doing. And he starts beating the robot with his fists. And he's a kind of unreconstrained. He's a Luddite. He hates technology. He hates all of it. Anyway, in those days, you couldn't have such a cop as a regular, and they made me kill him. But then several years later, I was put in charge of the show.

And within 10 days, two weeks, I had 138 co-sponsors, Republicans and Democrats signed on this bill. I wrote a note across the top of my dear colleague letter in blue pen and said, dear Mr. President, I know you care about our troops, please make this happen.

And Lincoln and Grant and other people said the Union could not have won that war without the help of these 200,000 or so black soldiers who fought in the war.

The literature of the 1930s is replete with examples of noise reduction systems that had been designed and that activity carried on at least until the outbreak of the Second World War. Everyone was hoping for some way of reducing noise and no one had succeeded. The cure always seemed to be worse than the disease. And naturally I was fascinated by this problem. I had been working at Ampex and the problem of noise was well known and understood by the engineers working in that field. My recognition that the noise is really very, very small in comparison with the loudest signal that one deals with in sound recording. Professional recorders at that time had signal to noise ratio of nominally 60 decibels. That's a voltage ratio of 1000 to 1. In other words, for a maximum signal height of this much, the noise is extremely small, one tenth of one percent.

And at that time, 1867, those British people reasonably well informed about candor, and some were, and those Americans who were the same, and I'm talking about people who had no bad feelings, no hostile feelings toward candor, took for granted that candor would disappear from the map within a few years. The guessing was that candor, which had gone halfway toward becoming a country, we were still a colony, it's often forgotten, after the Confederation we were still a colony, but we would go all the way to being independent and become a country, and then realize that it made no sense, because all the power, all the wealth, all the population was in the United States, and all the lines, natural lines of geography and communication, transportation, finance, and so on went north-south. And they wanted us. They wanted us, of course they did, it was manifest destiny, they wanted to stretch up to the pole. And two things stopped them. One was the very curious, hard to understand objectively, cold-bloodedly, choice of Canadians not to become Americans. They just didn't want to become Americans. The second one was this guy, John A. MacDonald. By some fluke, we were very lucky. We were a runty little backward provincial colony on the edge of civilization. That's all we were in 1867, we shouldn't pretend anymore. We had in John A. MacDonald, what I honestly, and I've looked at things with some care, I would put him in the absolute top class of all national leaders in democracies. That is, I would put him up there with Benjamin Disraeli, the British Prime Minister, and Abraham Lincoln, of course the great American. So the best of his time, you mean? Best of his time, he was just, it's uncanny that such an able politician, and he was extraordinary, I can tell you, to give you examples, of his ability to understand what was really going on, then figure out how to manipulate the politician into doing what he thought was necessary, and what he thought was necessary was to build Canada. Well you've compared him to other leaders of other democracies, and let's just, let's figure out how much democracy we actually had going on in the country at the time, because Canada's a country of three and a half million people at the time, basically one city, and it's not the city we're in now, it's Montreal, Toronto's 60,000 people. Toronto was quite small. How much democracy do we have in Canada at the time? At the time, well actually only about 20% of people had the vote, no women to start with, no native people, no aboriginals to add to that, and then anybody who didn't own property, and you had to own a minimum amount of property, the theory being that those people who had property had a house to protect, or whatever farm.",RichardGwyn_5.wav,C:\dementia_data\dementia-20251028T051047Z-1-001\dementia\Richard Gwyn\RichardGwyn_5.wav

They had the reason for it. He and Enrico Caruso, RCA Victor. But then Bing Crosby was the first singer who created the art of intimate singing using a microphone. Before that, all the entertainers and opera singers sang without a microphone. And he was the first one to actually get a microphone and kind of whisper intimately into the microphone. And he hypnotized the whole world. Even in Germany, during the war, they called him Der Bingle. And he was just international. He won two Academy Awards and really deserved each one. Big, big, like one movie called Country Girl, the other one Going My Way. And he taught us all how to make a living. Bing Crosby really showed us how to...",TonyBennett_15.wav,C:\dementia_data\dementia-20251028T051047Z-1-001\dementia\Tony Bennett\TonyBennett_15.wav

And then I, because in Mexico over the years, I just couldn't find out why I had this chronic pain. I mean, I knew because pro wrestling is not ballet. My memory was going and I was just suffering major depression. And I didn't know what was going on and I got diagnosed with the beginning stages of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's because of all the accidents and headshots and things like that and concussions. And I couldn't find the treatment that I needed in Mexico. And the stress of Mexico, doing business in Mexico, living in the city of 32 million people, it was I had to do something to save my life and because I was dying, I had a stroke and I got like a, in Spanish they say pre-infarto. So a stroke is like not a heart attack, but it's before the heart attack, right? Or it's kind of. Sure. So it was like, I'm not ready to die yet. I mean, I've survived kidnapping, stabbing, shootings, gang life, this is that. The other thing, drug overdoses, life. And I was like, this is impossible that I'm so happy to be part of the human race that it's going to be taken away from me because of pro wrestling. And I was like, no, I can't do it. So I came here because I'm determined to see my daughter grow up. And that was my motivation to get better.

dementia,woodydurham_0,2,"It was not on my radar or anything. Homer Rice was the athletic director then. And Homer called me one day in Greensboro and said, Woody, how about driving down tomorrow and have lunch with me? I'd like to talk to you about our games. And to be a nice guy, I said, yeah, I'd like to do that. So I did, and it was really interesting because the next day when I walked into his office, and I have a pretty good idea, Susan Strobel, who was the administrative assistant to the athletic director for a number of years, first Chuck Erickson, then Coach Rab, and finally Homer Rice, and she also worked for John Swafford some before she retired. And I'd known Susan, and Susan knew I went to school at Carolina. And I think she probably told Homer, why didn't he give me a call? And so when I walked in the office and he got up to shake my hand and welcome me, he said, I found out something interesting about you yesterday. And I said, really, what's that? He said, I found out you went to school here. And I laughed and I said, well, Homer, if I've been doing ACC basketball with Jim Thacker and Bones McKinney for four years on ACC television, and you didn't know until yesterday that I went to school here, and I've been doing a heck of a job staying neutral. And we had a good laugh on it. But then I got interested in it and decided I'd try to get it. And Bill Dooley was a football coach then, and Coach Smith was a basketball coach, and he had been named head coach while I was in school in the summer of 1961. And I called them both and I said, if I try to go for this, will you give me your support? And they both said they would, and they did. And so that's how it all got started.",woodydurham_0_2.wav,C:\dementia_data\dementia-20251028T051047Z-1-001\dementia\Woody Durham\woodydurham_0_2.wav
